### A05-Family tree via graphviz

### Rakesh Rapallo

### Description

This is a generation of the family tree using a dot syntax in graphviz.
I have generated this family tree by writing the dot syntax manually rather than generating it using python cause the output image i got for the python generated is messy and doesn't make any sense and i couldn't figure the way to fix it so that i have written the dot syntax myself and have created 7 generations for which i got the output image which is small compared to to the one generated via python using dwarf family tree that is provided but atleast here the output make sense so i kept this.I have used my own names and clan names taken from online.

In the dot syntax, the red is for male and purple is for female and the clan names are organised based on their marragies in a way that women changes theeir clan. after marraige while men keeps the original clan.
