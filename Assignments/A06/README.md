### Description

Trello is a web-based project management and collaboration tool that helps individuals and teams organize their tasks and projects. It uses a visual interface with boards, lists, and cards to represent tasks and their progress.

### Features

- Boards: A board represents a project or a team. It acts as a container for lists and cards. You can create multiple boards for different projects or purposes.

- Lists: Within each board, you can create lists to categorize tasks or stages of a project. Common lists could be "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

- Cards: Cards are the individual tasks or items within lists. You can create cards for specific tasks and add details such as descriptions, due dates, labels, attachments, and checklists.

- Drag and Drop: Trello's interface allows you to easily drag and drop cards between lists and boards to update their status or progress.

- Collaboration: Trello supports collaboration among team members. You can invite others to join your board and assign cards to specific team members. Additionally, you can leave comments, attach files, and mention team members to communicate and collaborate effectively.
