## Drag and drop: 

- Trello's interface allows you to easily drag and drop cards between lists and boards to update their status or progress.

## Collaboration: 

- Trello supports collaboration among team members. You can invite others to join your board and assign cards to specific team members. Additionally, you can leave comments, attach files, and mention team members to communicate and collaborate effectively.

### Automation: 

- Trello also supports automation where it lets us create some rules and buttons which gets the job done easier.
  
   1. ## Rules:
      
        - This let's us add an action based on the trigger that you will set before the action.
      
        - Now whenever you do that action in the board, the specific autmotion that you have set will be performed.
      
        - You can add this automation to all the boards you have.
      
        - You can also delete the automation

   2. ##  Buttons:
 
        - You can create buttons to do a specific task that you choose while setting it up.
        - You can choose an icon and give name for the button.
        - Then add the action you want it to perform when clicked
        - This feature is very useful when you are working on a project and there is this one task or an action that needs to be done 
          repetitively, with this you donâ€™t need to do that manually all the time. You can just click the button and boom the job is done.

### Power-ups: 

- Power-ups is a feature that let's the trello connect with other tools like slack, figma, gmail, teams and many more.
- The way you connect to other tool using power-up is click on power-ups in the top right corner of the app.
- Then select the tool you want to connect with from the list.
- Now you have to give the access to trello.
- And add the slack user name to the trello.
- Then you can use the tool.
  
## Slack: 

- Now let's see what all we can do by connecting slack with trello.

- You can select the workspace you want to connect it with the board you are on.
  
- Then select the alerts you want to send to the slack when performed on the trello, you will also add to which slack channel you want the 
  alerts to be sent and you are done.

- Now when you make any changes to the board like adding a card, moving a card then it will send that as an alert to the slack channel.

- This will be very useful in notifying people on the slack that are not currently on your board.
